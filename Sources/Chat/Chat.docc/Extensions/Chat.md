# ``Chat/Chat``

The chat server manages the async connection and the rest of the job for you, and you could send or receive messages or create a channel or group chat.


## Overview

The Chat class is the main class in the whole chat SDK, so you should take into consideration that this class is all that you need to connect and get your answer and it will tell you to result or maybe events that occur on the server with ``ChatDelegate``.
